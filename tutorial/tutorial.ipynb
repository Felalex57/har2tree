    "Crawling a web page can sound like a bit of an abstract concept at first. How exactly can we extract data from a web page? What data is really interesting to look at? Where can it be found?  \n",
    "\n",
    "&rarr; Every web browser generates a **[HAR file](https://www.keycdn.com/support/what-is-a-har-file#:~:text=HAR%2C%20short%20for%20HTTP%20Archive,times%2C%20and%20page%20rendering%20problems.)** (short for http archive) when loading a web page. This file mostly contains information about what resources are loaded by the browser, as it was firstly designed to identify possible performance issues. However, as the whole file is in a *standard JSON* format, **we can reverse engineer the process to extract useful information** and make a whole tree out of all the resources found in that HAR file. This step is particularly important as it is really complicated to understand what is going on by simply looking at the HAR file. *Example [here](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/Felalex57/8a90a3bd0628e3aef16ee04fb08e7e7e/raw/ecee33d26c5696989c600ba87683becff270ccc1/example.har)!*\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will guide you through the core features that **[Har2Tree](https://github.com/Lookyloo/har2tree)** offers.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also important to note that Har2Tree is an API based on the **[TreeNode](http://etetoolkit.org/docs/latest/reference/reference_tree.html) class of ETE3 Toolkit** and that a lot of help can be found on the documentation there in case you want to know a bit more about how the program works."
